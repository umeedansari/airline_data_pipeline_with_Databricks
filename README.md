# ✈️ Data Pipeline: Bronze, Silver & Gold Layers

This repository outlines the implementation of a **multi-layered data pipeline** built on **Databricks**, using **Delta Lake architecture**, **Auto Loader**, and **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**.

It processes airline-related data across domains like **Bookings**, **Flights**, **Passengers**, and **Airports**, and transforms it through the classic **Bronze → Silver → Gold** data layering pattern.

## 🟫 Bronze Layer – Raw Data Ingestion

The **Bronze Layer** is responsible for ingesting raw CSV files from cloud storage into Delta Lake using **Databricks Auto Loader**.

### Key Features:
- Streaming ingestion with support for **schema evolution** and **rescue mode**
- Reusable logic parameterized by domain (e.g., Flights, Bookings)
- Checkpointing enabled for fault tolerance
- Data stored as-is in Delta format, preserving original structure

### 🔁 Orchestration:

- A **Databricks Job** is created to run the ingestion logic per domain.
- Uses **Databricks widgets** to dynamically pass folder names (e.g., `Flights`, `Bookings`, etc.)
- The job can be triggered **manually or scheduled**, and it processes new data in micro-batches.

## 🪙 Silver Layer – Cleaned & Conformed Data

The **Silver Layer** processes raw Bronze data into structured and validated datasets using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**.

### Key Features:
- **DLT pipeline** manages transformations and automates deployment
- Implements **data quality expectations** (e.g., non-null primary keys)
- Adds **audit columns** like `modified_date` for tracking changes
- Uses **`create_auto_cdc_flow`** to manage **Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD1)**
- Each domain (Airports, Flights, etc.) is handled via reusable logic

### 🔁 Orchestration:

- A **DLT Pipeline Job** handles all Silver transformations.
- It can be configured to run **in triggered or continuous mode**.
- Simplifies execution by encapsulating notebook logic within the DLT framework.

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Business-Focused Dimensions & Facts

The **Gold Layer** consists of cleaned and joined **dimension** and **fact** tables ready for analytics, BI tools, or reporting.

### 1. ⭐ Dimension Tables
- Surrogate keys generated for each dimension table
- Upsert logic handles both new and changed records using `modified_date`
- Maintains `created_date` and `updated_date` for audit purposes

### 2. 📊 Fact Table
- Bookings data acts as the main fact table
- Joins with all dimension tables using natural keys → surrogate keys
- Supports **CDC-based incremental loads**
- Handles **backdated refreshes** when needed
- Outputs a fully denormalized fact table with measures (e.g., `amount`)

## 🥇 Gold Layer – Job Orchestration

The Gold Layer job runs as a **multi-task job** in Databricks, orchestrating dynamic dimension and fact table builds.

- **dimension_params:** Defines the parameters for dimension processing.
- **dimension_tables:** Loops through and builds each dimension dynamically.
- **fact_table:** Runs after dimensions to build the final fact table with surrogate keys and measures.
